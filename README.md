# Mars Rover

The aim of this program is to simulate the movement of Mars rovers in a similar style to turtle programs. It will take in small inputs for creating the plateau the rovers will act on, placing rovers, and moving the rovers.

## How to move around

To create the plateau, enter 2 numbers representing the x and y coordinate size of the grid. A rover can then be created at a given position and direction. Movement can then be dictated through the letters `L`, `R`, and `M`, meaning left, right, and move respectively. Movement is only one grid space at a time.

An example to move the rover diagonally by two squares would be:
- `5 5`
- `0 0 N`
- `MLMRMLM`
